 Social Media Posts Tips
1. Be relevant [how do you know if you're relevant? By asking your audience what they care about and/or listening to what they are already talking about and responding to].
2. Add relevant, high-quality visuals to your social posts.
3. Tell stories on social media: learn more about how to tell a good story, here.
4. Check yourself before you post:
- Will this post stop people from scrolling [/would it stop me]?
- Is it clear within a second who this post is for?
- Is this valuable for people that have never heard about me?
- Is it actually valuable or just descriptive?
- Does it tell a story?
- Is there a clear CTA?
- Would I interact with this post?
